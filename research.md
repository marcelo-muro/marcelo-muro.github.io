# 🧑‍🔬 Research & Publications

## 🔬 Research Areas
I am currently working on:
- **District Heating Networks**: Developing and validating a Modelica-based library for operational and control studies.
- **Hydrogen Blending in Gas Networks**: Studying gas quality and network dynamics using dynamic modeling and simulation approach.
- **Nuclear Hybrid Energy Systems**: Investigating the operational flexibility of Small Modular Reactors (SMR) and their potential role in nuclear hybrid energy systems (NHES).
